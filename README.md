# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression Classification
# 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to build a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical data. It uses the classic logistic regression algorithm and provides a full workflow: data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation and interpretation of the results.

# 🧮 Dataset

* Source: Provide the source of the dataset 

* Features: Briefly list the key features used (e.g., age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.).

* Target variable: Whether the patient has heart disease (binary).

#  Pre-processing steps:
* Handling missing values

* Encoding categorical features

* Feature scaling/normalization (if used)

* Train-test split (e.g., 80/20 or 70/30)

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

* Summary statistics of features.

* Data visualization: histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap.

* Observations found during EDA (e.g., which features correlate most strongly with heart disease).

# 📊 Model Development

* Algorithm: Logistic Regression (binary classification).

* Hyperparameters: Note any key parameters used (e.g., regularization strength, solver).

* Training: Describe how the train/test split was used, any cross-validation, performance metrics tracked.

* Feature selection (if any): Whether features were selected or reduced.

# 📈 Evaluation & Results

* Metrics reported: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

* Provide a table of results on test set.

* Possibly include visualizations like ROC curve, confusion matrix.

* Key insights: e.g., “Model achieved ~X% accuracy with Y features; top predictors were …”.

  # 🙋 Future Work

* Try other classification algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) and compare performance.

* Conduct hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV).

* Deploy the model as a web application or API for real-time prediction.

* Add further interpretability (feature importance, SHAP values).
